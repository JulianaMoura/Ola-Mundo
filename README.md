# Hello, World!
This is my first repository on GitHub. It aims to practice my skills and write down important information about Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and others.

## Special Thanks
I would like to thank the ones who provide time and knowledge to help me in my first steps as a programmer.
